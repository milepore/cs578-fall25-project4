Schnorr-based Disjunctive Zero-Knowledge Proof Implementation

This module provides a cryptographically sound zero-knowledge proof system
for proving that a secret value is either 0 or 1 without revealing which one.

Uses elliptic curve cryptography with secp256r1 curve and the Fiat-Shamir
heuristic for non-interactivity.

    Implementation of Schnorr-based disjunctive zero-knowledge proof for vote validity.
    
    This proves that an encrypted vote contains either 0 or 1 without revealing which one.
    Uses elliptic curve cryptography with secp256r1 curve and Fiat-Shamir heuristic
    for non-interactivity.
    
    The proof demonstrates: "I know a secret vote v such that v ∈ {0, 1} and 
    the encrypted vote corresponds to v" without revealing whether v = 0 or v = 1.
    
    Security Properties:
    - Zero-Knowledge: Reveals nothing about the actual vote value
    - Soundness: Invalid proofs cannot be created (computationally infeasible)
    - Completeness: Valid proofs always verify correctly
    - Non-Interactive: No interaction required between prover and verifier
    - Binding: Proof is tied to specific encrypted vote (prevents replay attacks)
