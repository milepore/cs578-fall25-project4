Schnorr-based  Zero-Knowledge Proof Implementation

This module provides a cryptographically sound zero-knowledge proof system
Supports two types of proofs:
* Disjunctive Proofs for vote validity (0 or 1) for proving that a secret
  value is either 0 or 1 without revealing which one.
* Partial decryption proof - to prove that the partial decryption was computed
  correctly using the voter's secret share without revealing the secret share itself.

Uses elliptic curve cryptography with secp256r1 curve and the Fiat-Shamir
heuristic for non-interactivity.
